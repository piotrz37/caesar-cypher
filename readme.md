# Caesar Cypher

## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cypher in javascript on the
command line. It was created as an example for people where this is used as a
technical test.

The instructions were to create an implementation of the Caesar Cypher with
command line arguments and a changeable shift amount.

## How to use
To encode text with a 5 letter shift you need to run:
`node cipher.js 'text to encode' 5`

To decode the text with a 5 letter shift you need to run:
`node cipher.js 'text to decode' 5 -d`

* -d tells the code that it will be shifting in reverse.
